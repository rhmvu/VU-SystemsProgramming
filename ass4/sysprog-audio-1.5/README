      Streaming Media Environment Reference Implementation. Version 1.5
      =================================================================


Note:
        * This library does NOT contain workable programs, but it
          shows skeletons of client and server programs. Adapt them to
          make your assignments.

Environment:
	* Linux Open Sound System via PulseAudio emulation. I.e. OSS is
	no longer part of standard Linux distributions, but it can be used
	via an emulation wrapper. See below.
	
Dependencies:
	* None

Files:
	* audio.h	: Wave header definition etc.
	* audio.c	: functions to abstract wave file format 
                          access & audio device manipulation

        The following files must only be taken as EXAMPLES of program
        skeletons. Feel free to change them as you like.

	* server.c	: sample streaming server 
	* client.c	: sample streaming client
        * library.h     : header for library.c
        * library.c     : sample filter libary 

Usage:
        Compile and link your program with audio.c
        Then run the program using the PulseAudio OSS Wrapper:
        
        padsp ./program
        
        This will ensure the aud_writeinit() function can find a /dev/dsp device 
        to which it can write your samples, thereby playing them.
